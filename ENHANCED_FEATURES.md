## 🚀 Usage Guide

### Creating Hierarchical Tasks:
1. Create a main task (parent)
2. Use "Add Subtask" button or select parent in task creation
3. Drag subtasks between parents
4. Monitor completion percentage automatically

### Managing Leave:
1. View leave balance in profile
2. Apply for leave through leave application form
3. Track application status
4. Request comp-offs for extra work

### Enhanced Task Board:
1. Access via `/tasks/?enhanced=true`
2. Drag tasks between stages and parents
3. Expand/collapse subtask groups
4. Visual connection lines show relationships

## 🔒 Permissions & Security

- Leave applications require approval (configurable per type)
- Task hierarchy maintains proper relationships
- API endpoints require authentication
- Attendance data is user-specific

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- Efficient database queries with select_related/prefetch_related
- AJAX loading for real-time data
- Optimized SVG rendering for connections
- Cached leave balance calculations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Migration Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. **Missing Data**: Run setup script after migration
3. **JavaScript Errors**: Check browser console for connection issues
4. **Drag Issues**: Ensure proper event handlers are loaded

### Debug Mode:
- Enable Django debug mode for detailed error messages
- Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoints return expected data

## 🔄 Future Enhancements
